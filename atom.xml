<p>In this second edition of Three.js news we have collected very creative and funky demos. Some of them  were developed for both desktop and mobile phones. Some are games, some are just pure fun. Using the latest technologies, they are all a clear example of what&#8217;s possible to do with web 3D today.</p>

<h2>Inconvergent Waves</h2>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/inconvergent_waves.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 10 42 57" />
<a href="http://inconvergent.net/waves/">Inconvergent waves</a> is a nicely done demo by <a href="https://twitter.com/inconvergent">Anders Hoff</a>. You can create waves by moving your mouse around. It&#8217;s like making ripples on the water. This technique is actually used as a method for generating landscapes. It&#8217;s very reactive and the movements are smooth and natural. Visit the inconvergent <a href="http://inconvergent.net/">website</a> to check out the developing process.</p>

<h2>Interactive WebGL globes</h2>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/interactive_webgl_globe.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 10 57 30" />
<a href="http://projects.delimited.io/webgl-globes/example_4_interactive_globe.html">Interactive WebGL</a> globes is a great way to improve your geography skills! This very educational and fun demo is a creation of <a href="https://twitter.com/delimitedtech">Steve Hall</a>. You mouseover the countries that you want and turn around by clicking on the interactive globe. Don&#8217;t hesitate to read Steve&#8217;s <a href="http://www.delimited.io/blog/2015/5/16/interactive-webgl-globes-with-threejs-and-d3">blogpost</a> to know more about his implementation of D3 and Three.js.</p>

<h2>Spiral Circle</h2>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/spiral_circle.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 10 58 52" /></p>

<p><a href="http://projects.delimited.io/subunit/demos/spiral-circle-v2.html">Spiral Circle</a> is another cool demo created by Steve Hall. It is based on <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock">mbostock’s</a> <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2472e84f78fd03df443f">example</a>. It is extremely hypnotic and it has kind of a disturbing texture, like the skin of a snake monster or something. You can pan to the left to divide the circle in two. Be careful, it&#8217;s alive!</p>

<h2>Hatsune Miku</h2>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/hatsune_miku_threejs.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 11 00 53" /></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku">Hatsune Miku</a> is a Three.js example <a href="http://takahirox.github.io/three.js/examples/webgl_loader_mmd.html">demo</a> done by <a href="https://twitter.com/superhoge">takahiro</a>. It&#8217;s a very fun demo even if takahiro is still working on improving it. This very cute blue hair girl is Japan&#8217;s sweetheart. She dances in holograms and does <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSyWtESoeOc">live concerts</a>&#8230;yeah i&#8217;m not kidding! We are even trying to bring her to life in <a href="https://twitter.com/LearningThreejs/status/600740523574439937">AR</a>.</p>

<h2>Race Against Oblivion</h2>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/race_against_oblivion.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 10 59 58" /></p>

<p>Race against oblivion or <a href="http://www.timeshift165.com/game">Timeshift</a> is an  original game made by <a href="http://www.ultranoir.com/en/#!/home/">Utranoir</a>. Inspired on the story of a unique French car : The Delahaye 165, you have to race against time to save this one of a kind automobile. The presentation of the game is outstanding, it has great design, background and effects. Bonus, it can be played on both desktop and mobile!</p>

<h2>A Particle Dream</h2>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/a_particle_dream.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 11 03 05" />
A Particle dream is a <a href="https://www.chromeexperiments.com/experiment/particle-dream">demo</a> created by <a href="http://www.iamnop.com/">Nop Jiarathanakul</a>. It is one of the latest Chrome experiments. It is a wonderful simulation of particles moving smoothly around. You can choose the shape you want the particles to morph into. The music and the ambiance mix together for a very relaxing result. Oh and you can actually use <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">Leap Motion</a> in this demo.</p>

<h2>Our Galactic Neighbourhood</h2>

<p><img src="http://learningthreejs.com/data/2015-05-27-learningthree-dot-js-news-stay-tuned-with-creative-3d-demos/our_galactic_neighborhood.png" alt="screen shot 2015-05-26 at 11 02 06" /></p>

<p><a href="http://charliehoey.com/threejs-demos/our-galactic-neighborhood.html">Our Galactic Neighbourhood</a>
is another very educational demo. Developed by creative coder <a href="http://charliehoey.com/">Charlie Hoey</a> this demo is a simulation of the charted stars in our Galaxy. You are able to explore the stars travelling both in space and time. Have you ever wondered how the stars are like lightyears away from Earth? Or how will they be thousands of years from now? This demo is your interstellar adventure.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this blogpost we reviewed some 3D demos for Three.js News. They are all very diverse. We saw games, educational projects, simulations and funky characters. What they all have in common is their creativity and the use of 3D technology on the web. Some even go further and incorporate fun control sensor like the Leap Motion device. Have fun checking out all these demos. I hope you enjoy them as much as we did.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more Three.js News and see you next time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post shows how to read your phone camera and make it appears as
transparent, aka to act as a see-through.
It may seems unrelated to 3d at first but
it is extremely useful in augmented reality.
I know it may seem silly :)
But this see-throught is the base of Augmented Reality in a phone.
This and other AR tech will be the subject of future posts.</p>

<p>It makes your device &#8216;appears as transparent&#8217;
So when the user is looking at her device, she is seeing the reality.
You just have to display your augmented part on top
and you got augmented reality. A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words :)</p>

<h2>How It Is Coded</h2>

<p>Webcams are great for interactivity.
  We will read the webcam thanks to <a href="http://www.webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a>,
  html5 API which can be used to do video/audio conferences like  Skype or Hangout.</p>

<p>In our case, we just get the video from the webcam
  with the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/getusermedia.html">getUserMedia() function</a>.
  we dont need all the network part.
  It is quite widespread according <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=stream">caniuse</a> which is great!
  You can learn more about it
  on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/getUserMedia">mdn</a>
  or <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/getusermedia/intro/">html5rocks</a></p>

<p>Now that we know how to get a video, which camera to pick ?
This demo is intended for phone. They often got multiple cameras nowsadays.
  typically a front camera for selfies
  a back camera for the normal photos.
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack">MediaStreamTrack</a> will list all the media source available in your browser.
  In webrtc vocabulary,
  front camera is called &#8216;user&#8217; facing video
  back camera is a &#8216;environment&#8217; facing .
  So we try to get the environment video camera if we can.</p>

<p>For the see-through effect to be convincing, we need to be careful.
  first we display the video stream in full screen, thus it
  is more real to the user.
  We display it in the background of the page with the proper css
Additionally we ensure we keep a proper
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_%28image%29">aspect ratio</a>,
  no matter the size of the browser window.
  So it isn&#8217;t streched.
So it must be robust to window resize and orientation change.
  All that makes the resize function more subtle than usual.
  but nothing dramatic</p>

<h2>Source</h2>

<p>Here is the full source of the effect.
It is in a <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/demo.seethroughphone">github repo</a>.
Enjoy!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everybody.</p>

<p>This is a new Three.js Online Meeting post. The idea is to interview people using <a href="http://threejs.org/">Three.js</a> in their projects. I think it is a great way to learn from each other and share our experiences.  You know me, I love three.js and I love talking about it. In this video of about 1 hour you are gonna see some interesting people really passionate about games and three.js</p>

<p>For this interview, i talked with
<a href="https://twitter.com/jcfrog">Jérôme CHOAIN</a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/_mig_">Michel Gutierrez</a>
, the guys behind <a href="https://www.jocly.com">Jocly Games</a>.
They have over 113 web board games with very cool features as you will see.  You can play on and off line with your friends, or just you and your computer. They also have some mobile apps that make their games even more accessible. You can dowload their games from <a href="https://apps.facebook.com/joclyfb/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Jocly">Google Play</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/aclap/id512525676">iTunes</a>. And good news for developers: you can create and embed your own games! It is tons of fun. Be sure to check it out.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>

    <id>http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2014/05/26/one-threex-a-day-challenge-phase-1-completed</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everybody!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been nearly a month since I started publishing <a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2014/04/22/one-threex-a-day-gets-your-game-on-its-way-a-challenge/">&#8220;One threex a day&#8221; challenge</a>. The idea was to share with you the many <a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">three.js games extensions</a> that I had written over time. I wanted to show you how they could be useful, fun and easy to include in your very own three.js game. I came up with a motto &#8220;One threex a day gets your game on its way&#8221;. I was all set up and ready to go. This was a challenge inspired by John Resig&#8217;s article called <a href="http://ejohn.org/blo!/write-code-every-day/">&#8220;Write code everyday&#8221;</a>. I deeply agree with his theory for making progress, increasing productivity and getting the work done. I wished to try something similar on myself.</p>

<p>Let me tell you though&#8230; it WAS challenging! Keeping the publication rhythm was hard. It takes a lot of discipline and organization to get it done everyday. I had the best intentions, but unfortunately I got sick and I felt bad for most of last week. Additionally I had some day work on the side that I needed to get done. At this rate of publication, it was very hard to keep up! At first I wanted to publish the threex extensions for a period of two months but I think it is best to rest for a while. So a week ago I published the last three.js game extension of phase 1.</p>

<p>The good news is that I&#8217;ve had a very interesting experience. I&#8217;m pleased with the results. Obviously, some posts got more attention than others. I think this was because the three.js game extensions I published weren&#8217;t all for hard-core developers or game creators. Some were pretty basic, but still had educational value for people just starting with three.js. I wanted them to be directed to all kinds of audience, amateurs and experts alike. I really appreciated the process of sharing these extensions, and overall I had a great response. I got some <a href="https://plus.google.com/104300307601542851567/posts/RhabZY19TSq">very</a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/104300307601542851567/posts/RqDbZNeJEkW">cool</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/siggraph/status/464238273582211072">retweets</a> and a lot of positive echo from you guys. Thanks a lot! Don&#8217;t hesitate to contact me and give me some more feedback.</p>

<p>I stopped publication last week, but wait&#8230;I&#8217;m not saying I&#8217;m giving up though. Far from it. I have promised myself, and I promise my readers, to come back with more three.js extensions. Especially, because I still have a lot to publish, there are still some tricks up my sleeve ;)  For the moment I will concentrate on regaining my strength, writing more code and documenting it for the next threex batch. I hope to deliver and publish it soon.</p>

<p>Stay tuned! I&#8217;ll be back.</p>

This is post is part of the <a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2014/04/22/one-threex-a-day-gets-your-game-on-its-way-a-challenge/">&#8216;one threex a day&#8217; challenge</a>.
This challenge is to publish every day one game extension for three.js!
One per day, every day and that for 2month!
In this post, we gonna talk about
<a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/#threex.text">threex.text</a>.
threex.text is a <a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/threex/">threex game extension for three.js</a> which makes it easy to add 3d text in your game. You can use it to create a big logo on top of a shop or a big sign of any kind Las Vegas style. Up to you to see :) It is very flexible. You can fine tune lots of parameters to make it fit your needs. You can choose the fonts, the size, the bevel, the weight etc&#8230;</p>

It show a 3d text and it is all loaded thru require.js</li>
</ul>


<h1>How To Install It</h1>

<p>You can install it via script tag</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&#39;threex.text.js&#39;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Or you can install with <a href="http://bower.io/">bower</a>, as you wish.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h1>How To Use It</h1>

<p>Here is a very basic usage</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>var <span class="nv">mesh</span>    <span class="o">=</span> new THREEx.Text<span class="o">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;THREEx&#39;</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>scene.add<span class="o">(</span>mesh<span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here is another example with more parameters. The options are passed directly
to  <code>THREE.TextGeometry</code>.

<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>var <span class="nv">mesh</span>    <span class="o">=</span> new THREEx.Text<span class="o">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;THREEx&#39;</span>, <span class="o">{</span>

This challenge is to publish every day one game extension for three.js!
One per day, every day and that for 2month!
In this post, we gonna talk about
<a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/#threex.terrain">threex.terrain</a>.
threex.terrain is a <a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">three.js games extension</a> which provides a procedural terrain generated from a simplex noise, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise">Perlin noise</a>. As you can see you have different zones that make the terrain more varied, the blue zone represents water, the green one represents trees or grass and the white zone at the mountain top is snow. Imagine your video game character walking on these 3D mountains or flying over them, pretty cool eh? You can take him through river, forest, wind and snow if you want ;)</p>

<h1>How To Install It</h1>

<p>You can install it via script tag</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&#39;threex.terrain.js&#39;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Or you can install with <a href="http://bower.io/">bower</a>, as you wish.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>bower install threex.terrain
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h1>How To Use It</h1>

<p>To allocate a heightMap with a width of 100 and a depth of 200, do</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">heightMap</span>   <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">THREEx</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Terrain</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">allocateHeightMap</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">200</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To generate some heights based on a simplex/perlin noise, do</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">THREEx</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Terrain</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">simplexHeightMap</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">heightMap</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you want to display it in three.js, built a <code>THREE.PlaneGeometry</code> for it</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To get the ground height of this mesh, use the following</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It is possible to enhance the rendering of this heightmap with some vertexColor, and a
smoother shading if you want.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>To get the height with heightMap coordinates, just use</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

This is post is part of the <a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2014/04/22/one-threex-a-day-gets-your-game-on-its-way-a-challenge/">&#8216;one threex a day&#8217; challenge</a>.

One per day, every day and that for 2month!
In this post, we gonna talk about
<a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/#threex.poolball">threex.poolball</a>.
threex.poolball is a <a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">three.js games extension</a> which helps you build pool balls. It provides dynamically generated models of pool balls, so no model download needed. It may be fun to play with when you start with three.js, funnier than a plain sphere for sure :) You can use it for your bar games, having  your characters bet when playing pool, or even your <a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/marbleTable/">Marble Table</a> games, as I did, adding cool granular sounds when the balls roll.</p>

threex.transparency is a <a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">three.js games extension</a> to easily handle transparency. Transparency is a tricky business in Webgl, but this extension makes it approachable. It is worth trying. Do you remember the transparency between the leaves of a tree in 3D games? Well, with this extension you will be able to add it to your own game. You can also make clouds appear transparent in the sky you have created for your game. It is easy to include and it gives a nice polish finish, a professional touch.</p>

<h2>How To Use It ?</h2>

<p>The algo is well described in this
<a href="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/intermediate-tutorials/tutorial-10-transparency/">opengl tutorial about transparency</a>. We just adapt it to fit three.js.
First you setup all the objects that you want to be transparent</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>THREEx.Transparency.init<span class="o">(</span>objects<span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It will change the <code>THREE.Material</code> to make it support transparent.
Second you need to update all your objects at every frame.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>THREEx.Transparency.update<span class="o">(</span>objects, camera<span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

This challenge is to publish every day one game extension for three.js!
One per day, every day and that for 2month!
In this post, we gonna talk about
<a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/#threex.cubecamera">threex.cubecamera</a>.
threex.cubecamera is a <a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">three.js games extension</a> which provides a helper for cube cameras. It is very useful when a given object must reflect a texture cube live. Just look at it, you can see the reflection as clear as a real life mirror! You can give your texture the color you want, for example in the demo I created a &#8220;gold&#8221; sphere to give it a shinier look. Be careful though, this requires 6 renderings of the scene every time you update it. It becomes expensive fast.</p>

<h1>How To Install It</h1>

<p>You can install it via script tag</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&#39;threex.cubecamera.js&#39;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Or you can install with <a href="http://bower.io/">bower</a>, as you wish.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>bower install threex.cubecamera
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h1>How To Use It</h1>

<p>First you need to create a classic mesh, the one which gonna reflect the live texture cube.
In this example, we gonna create sphere with the color &#8216;gold&#8217; like this.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>var <span class="nv">geometry</span>    <span class="o">=</span> new THREE.SphereGeometry<span class="o">(</span>0.5, 32, 16<span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>var <span class="nv">material</span>    <span class="o">=</span> new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial<span class="o">({</span>
</span><span class='line'>    color   : <span class="s1">&#39;gold&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">})</span>
</span><span class='line'>var <span class="nv">mesh</span>    <span class="o">=</span> new THREE.Mesh<span class="o">(</span>geometry, material<span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>scene.add<span class="o">(</span> mesh <span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we needs to create the cube camera which gonna update the texture cube live.
We do that like this.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>var <span class="nv">cubeCamera</span>  <span class="o">=</span> new THREEx.CubeCamera<span class="o">(</span>mesh<span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>scene.add<span class="o">(</span>cubeCamera.object3d<span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Don&#8217;t forget to update it when needed (likely at every frame)</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>cubeCamera.update<span class="o">(</span>renderer, scene<span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now that we got the textureCube, we set the mesh material to reflect this texture cube.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>material.envMap <span class="o">=</span> cubeCamera.textureCube
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is it! Now you got the live texture cube on your sphere :)</p>

One per day, every day and that for 2month!
In this post, we gonna talk about
<a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/#threex.suzanne">threex.suzanne</a>.
Suzanne is a classic. She is the blender famous model familiar to all blender users. It is also a <a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">three.js games extension</a> extension which provides you with a monkey model. Blender wanted to create a less common test model, so Suzanne was born. She is more precisely a 3D model of a chimpanzee head. It is pretty basic but you can easily add it as a funky animal character and install it in your platform games!</p>

<p>Sometime it is not desirable to wait for the loading to complete before
adding the object to the scene. To avoid this, we create a container
which will contains the model once loading is completed.
Thanks to the scene graph inheritance, any position/quaternion/scale
changes made on container, will be reported to the children meshes.</p>

threex.vertexanimation is a <a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">three.js games extension</a> which provides easy vertex animation. You can see your object move as if it&#8217;s got a life of its own! You can use it to make the objects in your game bounce, dance or move in funky ways. You can add it in your games to get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flubber_(film)">Flubber</a> effect. The best part about it is that you can get creative. You can morph or deform your objects to transform them into other objects. It is really fun to experiment with!</p>

<p>Hello everybody! This is my first <em>Three.js Interview</em> video. The inspiration came from all those great people out there doing <a href="http://threejs.org">very cool projects with three.js</a>. I want to share their innovations with others. If you know me, you know that I love talking about three.js. So, I would like everybody to have the opportunity to enjoy and learn from these <a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/categories/threejsInterview/">three.js interviews</a>. So three.js interviews are videos of around one hour where people are talking about cool things they do with three.js . Maybe you could get some ideas for your own project or simply partake on a subject you&#8217;re passionate about.</p>

<p><a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7709928' target='_blank'><input type="button" value='discuss it on hacker news' /></a></p>

<p>The idea is to have interesting people come and talk about cool things that they&#8217;ve done with three.js. Like <a href="https://twitter.com/BenAtExocortex">Ben Houston</a>, who is our guest in this first video. Ben is the Team Leader for <a href="http://clara.io/">Clara.io</a>, a online 3D modeling and rendering tool that you can use inside you browser. Ben talks to us about the creation and the evolution of <a href="http://clara.io/">Clara.io</a> and about all the interesting features it&#8217;s got!</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy it and stay tuned for the next Three.js Interview :)</p>

This challenge is to publish every day one game extension for three.js!
One per day, every day and that for 2month!
In this post, we gonna talk about
<a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/#threex.md2character">threex.md2character</a>.
threex.md2character is a
<a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">three.js game extension</a>
which provides a model of a monster.
His name is &#8216;ratmahatta&#8217; and is from quake era.
It is animated, can hold a weapon, skin may be changed. Pretty sweet.
you got <strong>12 weapons to choose from</strong>, <strong>5 different skins</strong> and <strong>16 distinct animations</strong>. Pretty complete!
It is easy to include in your game, maybe in a cave or a dungeon :)
It is from
<a href="http://threejs.org/examples/webgl_morphtargets_md2.html">webgl_morphtargets_md2.html three.js example</a>.
The model is make by

<h1>Show Don&#8217;t Tell</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/threex.md2character/examples/select.html">examples/select.html</a>
[<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.md2character/blob/master/examples/select.html">view source</a>] :
It shows all the possibilities for the skins, the weapons and the animations.</li>
<li><a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/threex.md2character/examples/ratmahattaplayer.html">examples/ratmahattaplayer.html</a>
[<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.md2character/blob/master/examples/ratmahattaplayer.html">view source</a>] :
It shows how to controls the mesh as if it was a player in a game with input
in the keyboard wasd or arrows keys.</li>
</ul>


<h1>How To Install It</h1>

<p>You can install it via script tag</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&#39;threex.md2character.js&#39;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Or you can install with <a href="http://bower.io/">bower</a>, as you wish.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>bower install threex.md2character
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h1>How To Use It</h1>

<h2>threex.md2characterratmahatta.js</h2>

<p>You typically create a ratamahatta like this</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>var <span class="nv">ratamahatta</span> <span class="o">=</span> new THREEx.MD2CharacterRatmahatta<span class="o">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>scene.add<span class="o">(</span>ratamahatta.character.object3d<span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Don&#8217;t forget to update it when you render with <code>ratamahatta.update(delta)</code>.Internally, it create a character and a controls. You can use them directly.
* <code>ratamahatta.character</code> instance of <code>THREEx.MD2Character</code>
* <code>ratamahatta.controls</code> instance of <code>THREEx.MD2CharacterControls</code></p>

<p>It has simple functions to set the skin, weapon and animations.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>ratamahatta.skinNames</code> is the names of available skins. It has 5 different skins <code>["ratamahatta", "ctf_b", "ctf_r", "dead", "gearwhore"]</code></li>
<li><code>ratamahatta.setSkinName(skinName)</code> set the skin based on its name</li>
<li><code>ratamahatta.weaponsNames</code> is the names of available weapons. It has 12 animation <code>["none", "weapon", "w_bfg", "w_blaster", "w_chaingun", "w_glauncher", "w_hyperblaster", "w_machinegun", "w_railgun", "w_rlauncher", "w_shotgun", "w_sshotgun"]</code></li>
<li><code>ratamahatta.setWeaponName(weaponName)</code> set the weapon based on its name</li>
<li><code>ratamahatta.animationNames</code> is the names of available animation. It has 16 animations <code>["stand", "run", "attack", "pain", "jump", "flip", "salute", "taunt", "wave", "point", "crstand", "crwalk", "crattack", "crpain", "crdeath", "death"]</code></li>
<li><code>ratamahatta.setAnimationName(animationName)</code> set the animation based on its name</li>
</ul>


<h2>threex.md2charactercontrols.js</h2>

<p>First you create controls for your character like this</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>var <span class="nv">controls</span>    <span class="o">=</span> new THREEx.MD2CharacterControls<span class="o">(</span>character.object3d<span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Dont forget to update it when you render with <code>controls.update(delta, now)</code>. The character is controlled by <code>controls.inputs</code> properties. You just have to set them to fit your need.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>control.inputs.right</code> is true if the character must go right</li>
<li><code>control.inputs.left</code> is true if the character must go left</li>
<li><code>control.inputs.up</code> is true if the character must go forward</li>
<li><code>control.inputs.down</code> is true if the character must go backward</li>
</ul>


<h2>threex.md2character.js</h2>

<p>It provide the base to play with the model.
It is a modified version of
<a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/js/MD2Character.js">MD2Character.js</a>
from this <a href="http://threejs.org/examples/webgl_morphtargets_md2.html">webgl_morphtargets_md2.html three.js example</a>.</p>

<p>First you create it.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>var <span class="nv">character</span>   <span class="o">=</span> new THREEx.MD2Character<span class="o">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Dont forget to update it at every frame with a <code>character.update(delta)</code></p>

<ul>
<li><code>character.object3d</code> is the THREE.Object3D container</li>
<li><code>character.setWireframe(boolean)</code> set the model in wireframe.</li>
<li><code>character.setWeapon(weaponIndex)</code> add a weapon in the character hand. <code>weaponIndex</code> is between 0 and 11. if -1, it removes the weapon.</li>
<li><code>character.setSkin(skinIndex)</code> set the skin of the character. <code>skinIndex</code> is between 0 and 4</li>
<li><code>character.setAnimation(animationName)</code> set the animation for the character. The name is one of <code>["stand", "run", "attack", "pain", "jump", "flip", "salute", "taunt", "wave", "point", "crstand", "crwalk", "crattack", "crpain", "crdeath", "death"]</code>.</li>
<li><code>character.setPlaybackRate(rate)</code> set the playback rate of the animation.</li>
<li><code>character.load(config)</code> loads the characters

<ul>
<li><code>character.addEventListener('loaded', function(){})</code> to be notified when the model is loaded</li>
<li><code>character.isLoaded()</code> is true if the model is loaded, false otherwise</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

threex.basiclighting is a <a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">threex game extension for three.js</a>. It provides
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_lighting">three point lighting</a>.
It is the lighting used in movies:
A key light on the front-left, a back light in the back and a fill light on the front right, nothing fancy.
It is perfect if you dunno much about lighting and you want to add lights in your games.
Nothing big or special in this extension.
This is mainly for educational purposes or for starting your project fast.</p>

threex.dynamictexture is a <a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">threex game extension for three.js</a>. It provides an easy way to handle dynamically generated texture.
Inspiration came from
the excelent <a href="http://www.babylonjs.com">babylon.js</a>
which got
<a href="https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/Babylon/Materials/textures/babylon.dynamicTexture.js">BABYLON.DynamicTexture</a>.
It is mainly used to write text in texture. Say you got a character which says something, you may want to put that in a texture and display that above your character. threex.dynamictexture will make it easy for you.</p>

This is post is part of the <a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2014/04/22/one-threex-a-day-gets-your-game-on-its-way-a-challenge/">&#8216;one threex a day&#8217; challenge</a>.
This challenge is to publish every day one game extension for three.js!
One per day, every day and that for 2month!
In this post, we gonna talk about
<a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/#threex.videotexture">threex.videotexture</a>.
threex.videotexture is a <a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">threex game extension for three.js</a>.
It provides help to handle videos in texture.
It is possible to put html5 <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> output in texture with <code>threex.videotexture.js</code>.
You can even put the webcam in a texture with <code>threex.webcamtexture.js</code>.
It is cool if you want to make a tv screen in your game, You can easily use this extension. You pick the video to play and you are ready to go.
The screen surface will use your video texture making it look like a TV set.
If you need it, you can try <code>threex.audiovideotexture.js</code> where the
video is mapped on the texture and additionnally the sound of the video
is handled via
<a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html">web audio API</a>.
Thus you can have localized sound, which is neat in the 3d environment.</p>

<h1>Show Don&#8217;t Tell</h1>

<ul>
<li>Here is a <a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/threex.videotexture/examples/videotexture.html">videotexture example</a> and its <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.videotexture/blob/master/examples/videotexture.html">source</a>.
It read the video from a file via video dom element and display it in a texture</li>
<li>Here is a <a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/threex.videotexture/examples/audiovideotexture.html">audio/video texture example with WebAudio API</a>and its <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.videotexture/blob/master/examples/audiovideotexture.html">source</a>.
It shows how to plug the video sound into the WebAudio API because you get localised sounds.
This is particularly useful in 3D.
&#8220;Audio/Video&#8221; texture is a texture where the sound comes from the object3d on which
the texture is mapped.</li>
<li>Here is another <a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/threex.videotexture/examples/webcamtexture.html">webcam example</a> and its <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.videotexture/blob/master/examples/webcamtexture.html">source</a>.
It reads the webcam thru getUserMedia and put it in a texture.</li>
</ul>


<h1>How To Install It</h1>

<p>You can install it manually. Just do</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&#39;threex.videotexture.js&#39;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can install with <a href="http://bower.io/">bower</a>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>bower install threex.videotexture
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>then you add that in your html</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;bower_components/threex.videotexture/threex.videotexture.js&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h1>How To Use it</h1>

<h2>threex.videotexture.js</h2>

<p>First you instanciate the texture itself</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="c1">// create the videoTexture</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">videoTexture</span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">THREEx</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">VideoTexture</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;videos/sintel.ogv&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">})</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then you use it in a mesh like this.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Here is the detailled API:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>videoTexture.video</code>: the video dom element from which the video is used</li>
<li><code>videoTexture.texture</code>: the generated <code>THREE.Texture</code></li>
<li><code>videoTexture.update(delta, now)</code>: update the texture from the video element</li>
<li><code>videoTexture.destroy()</code>: destroy the object</li>
</ul>


<h2>threex.webcamtexture.js</h2>

<p>It will read the webcam using
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator.getUserMedia">getUserMedia</a>.
The browser
will likely ask for permissions to the users.
Let&#8217;s see how to use it. You instanciate the texture itself.</p>

threex.laser is a <a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">threex</a> game extension for three.js. It provides a laser beam effect. Excellent to add in your space game!
The laser itself is fully procedural with generated texture.
The bleeding effect is obtained with additive blending.
threex.laser contains a more elaborate laser which dynamically collides with your scene. It is all done for you and it looks great! On impact, there is a point light and an particle sprite for cooler effects :)</p>

It shows a usage of threex.lasercooked.js. The laser is inside a cube, the cube is
filled with toruses positioned at random, and the laser is colliding with other objects.</li>
</ul>


<h1>How To Install It</h1>

<p>You can install it via script tag</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&#39;threex.laserbeam.js&#39;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&#39;threex.lasercooked.js&#39;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Or you can install with <a href="http://bower.io/">bower</a>, as you wish.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>bower install threex.laser
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h1>How To Use It</h1>

<h2>threex.laserbeam.js</h2>

<p>It is a raw laser beam using dynamic textures.
Here is to create the laser beam and add it to the scene.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">laserBeam</span>   <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">THREEx</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">LaserBeam</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">scene</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">laserBeam</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>threex.lasercooked.js</h2>

<p>It is a laser beam with dynamic collision.
On impacts, to increase realism, there is sprite and point light.
It depends on <code>THREEx.LaserBeam</code> so first create it and add it to the scene</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">laserBeam</span>   <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">THREEx</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">LaserBeam</span><span class="p">()</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then you create the laserCooked based on it. Don&#8217;t forget to update it in your render loop.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

This is post is part of the <a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2014/04/22/one-threex-a-day-gets-your-game-on-its-way-a-challenge/">&#8216;one threex a day&#8217; challenge</a>. This challenge is to publish every day one game extension for three.js! One per day, every day and that for 2month! In this post, we gonna talk about <a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/#threex.oimo">threex.oimo</a>.
threex.oimo is a <a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">threex game extension for three.js</a>. It provides a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_physics">realistic physics</a> easy to include in your own games. So you can take objects in your game and make them fall as if it was the real world! You can code a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pool_(cue_sports)">pool game</a> in a day!
You make rocks fall from the sky in a realistic fashion! Sky is the limit!
It is a warper over the excelent library <a href="https://github.com/lo-th/Oimo.js">oimo.js</a> physics library. <a href="https://plus.google.com/114170447432405103307/posts">lo-th</a>, the author does <a href="http://3dflashlo.wordpress.com/">a lot of crazy things</a>! Be sure to check it out!</p>

It shows a bunch of cube and sphere falling on a ground.</li>
<li><a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/threex.oimo/examples/demo.html">examples/demo.html</a>
[<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.oimo/blob/master/examples/demo.html">view source</a>] :
It shows a more elaborate rendering. Planets falling down a pyramid in space.</li>
</ul>


<h1>How To Install It</h1>

<p>You can install it via script tag</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'> &lt;script src='threex.oimo.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Or you can install with <a href="http://bower.io/">bower</a>, as you wish.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>bower install threex.oimo</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h1>How To Use It</h1>

<p>Well first you need to create a oimo.js world. You do that like this</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>var world   = new OIMO.World()</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then, at every frame, update your mesh position/rotation.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>world.step()</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then you need to create physics bodies and make them move</p>

<h2>.createBodyFromMesh()</h2>

<p>It will create the <code>IOMO.Body</code> from a three.js mesh you give it.
Currently it support <code>THREE.CubeGeometry</code> and <code>THREE.SphereGeometry</code>. First create a normal <code>THREE.Mesh</code></p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>var geometry    = new THREE.CubeGeometry(1,1,1)
</span><span class='line'>var material    = new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial()
</span><span class='line'>var mesh    = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material )
</span><span class='line'>scene.add(mesh)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then you create the <code>IOMO.Body</code> for it</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>var body    = THREEx.Iomo.createBodyFromMesh(world, mesh)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>.Body2MeshUpdater()</h2>

<p>It will update the position/rotation of a <code>THREE.Mesh</code>
based on a position/rotation of a <code>IOMO.Body</code>. You need
this to see your meshes moves according to oimo.js physics.
First you create the object</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>var updater = new THREEx.Iomo.Body2MeshUpdater(body, mesh)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then, at every frame, update your mesh position/rotation.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>updater.update()</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>.Stats()</h2>

<p>It will display statistic from oimo.js, it may be useful to know what is going on.
It acts very much like
<a href="">mrdoob&#8217;s stats</a>
or
<a href="">threex.rendererstats</a>.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>var oimoStats   = new THREEx.Iomo.Stats(world)
</span><span class='line'>document.body.appendChild(oimoStats.domElement)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then, at every frame, update it.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>oimoStats.update()</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

In this post, we gonna talk about
<a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/#threex.crates">threex.crates</a>.
threex.crates is a <a href="http://www.threejsgame.com/extensions/">threex game extension for three.js</a>.
It provides <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crate">crates</a> models, 3 of them to be accurate.
Yeah you heard me, this is only boxes of wood. Why doing an extension for that?
Well, because crates are like a myth in 3d graphics, we put them everywhere.
So if you need crates to easily put in your game, you know where to find them now :)</p>

This is post is part of the <a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2014/04/22/one-threex-a-day-gets-your-game-on-its-way-a-challenge/">&#8216;one threex a day&#8217; challenge</a>.
This challenge is to publish every day one game extension for three.js!
One per day, every day and that for 2month!
In this post, we gonna talk about
<a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/#threex.coloradjust">threex.coloradjust</a>.
threex.coloradjust is a
<a href="http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/">threex game extension for three.js</a>.
It provides a color adjustement in post processing.
It happens on the whole screen and changes every colors giving a whole new ambiance to your games.
It includes smooth transitions between each ambiance.
There are 22 ambiances going from &#8216;sepia&#8217;, to &#8216;thermal&#8217;, or &#8216;radioactive&#8217;.
I highly recommend &#8216;nightvision&#8217; if your game is about fps shooting at night!
It is very flexible, you can build your own ambiance with any image editing software.
It is ported from
<a href="http://webglsamples.googlecode.com/hg/color-adjust/color-adjust.html">color-adjust demo</a>
by
<a href="http://greggman.com/">greggman</a>.
Here is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfQ8rKGTVlg#t=25m03s">video</a>
where you can see greggman explaining the underlying technic.
It explains how to do 3d texture in webgl! :)</p>

<li><a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/threex.coloradjust/examples/basic.html">examples/basic.html</a>
[<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.coloradjust/blob/master/examples/basic.html">view source</a>] :
It shows how to use the <code>THREEx.ColorAdjust.Renderer</code>.
It changes the color cube randomly every 3-seconds just to put some animations</li>

[<a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.coloradjust/blob/master/examples/demo.html">view source</a>] :
It show an video with the adjusted colors.
You can play with it to get a better feeling of what this effect can do for you.</li>
</ul>


<h1>How To Install It</h1>

<p>You can install it via script tag</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&#39;threex.coloradjust.js&#39;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Or you can install with <a href="http://bower.io/">bower</a>, as you wish.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>bower install threex.coloradjust
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h1>How To Use It</h1>

<p>It build the passes for the color effect.
It exposes <code>colorPass.colorPass</code> for a <code>THREE.EffectComposer</code> instance.</p>

<p>Create an instance</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>var <span class="nv">colorPasses</span> <span class="o">=</span> new THREEx.ColorAdjust.Passes<span class="o">()</span>;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Everytime you render the scene, be sure to update it</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>colorPasses.update<span class="o">(</span>delta, now<span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then you add those passes to an <code>THREE.EffectComposer</code> like that</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>colorPasses.addPassesTo<span class="o">(</span>composer<span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Tuning</h3>

<p>This module comes with a set of predefined <em>color cubes</em> : 22 of them to be exact.
You can set the color cube you want: one of the 22 already provided, or your own.
It default to <code>default</code>.
Here is the full list of available colors adjustement : default,
monochrome,
sepia,
saturated,
posterize,
inverse,
color-negative,
high-contrast-bw,
funky-contrast,
nightvision,
thermal,
black-white,
hue-plus-60,
hue-plus-180,
hue-minus-60,
red-to-cyan,
blues,
infrared,
radioactive,
goolgey,
bgy.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="c1">// set color adjustement to &#39;nightvision&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">colorPasses</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">setColorCube</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;nightvision&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There is a smooth linear transition between the old colorCube and the new colorCube.
You can tune the delay like this.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="c1">// set the transition delay to 2 seconds</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">colorPasses</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">delay</span>   <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
